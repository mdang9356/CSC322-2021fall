            <li><h3>Louisvile city</h3></li>
            <p class="p1">If you only have time to visit one city in Kentucky it should be Louisville. It is home to Churchill Downs horse racetrack and most known for its annual Kentucky Derby, which attracts horse lovers from around the world. The city is one of the oldest in the state, founded in 1778, so you will find a lot of history here.

                Start your Louisville visit on West Main Street in downtown, one of the most historic sections of the city. The downtown area's Museum Row has 10 attractions to visit, including the Muhammad Ali Center, the Louisville Slugger Museum, the Kentucky Science Center, and the Frazier History Museum.</p>

            <li><h3>Cumberland Gap</h3></li>
            <p  class="p1">
                The majestic Cumberland Gap near Middlesboro, Kentucky is one of the best places to visit for outdoor beauty in the state. The Cumberland Gap National Historical Park is not only a beautiful area but it's also historic: early settlers used it to move buffalo to the west. There are more than 85 miles of trails. Most are easily accessible, but some backcountry trails spread across the 24,000 acres of wilderness.

Besides the many outdoor experiences at the Cumberland Gap, you can visit the Hensley Settlement in the park, which is a living history village representative of early Appalachian settlement. The Cumberland Gap Visitor Center, the Artists Co-op, and Mitty's Metal Art workshop are also fun stops in the park if you are looking to fill out a day in the area.

            <li><h3>Bowling Green</h3></li>
            <p  class="p2">
                The town of Bowling Green is one of the best places to visit in Kentucky, especially if you are an automotive or aviation enthusiast. It is home to the National Corvette Museum, where you can see a large collection of restored vintage Corvettes and exhibits related to the iconic American car.

Bowling Green's contributions to transportation are also on display at the Historic Railpark and Train Museum and the Aviation Heritage Park, which are both open to visitors.

            <li><h3>Mammoth Cave National Park</h3></li>
            <p  class="p3">
                The massive cave system at Mammoth Cave National Park, near Brownsville in central Kentucky, is the longest known in existence in the world. There are more than 400 miles of pathways and cave chambers, and many are open to visitors for tours. Several types of tours are available that showcase dripstone formations and other natural elements inside the cave system.

                In addition to exploring the caves, this is one of the best places to visit in Kentucky because there are so many other things to do in the park, like kayaking or fishing on the Nolin River and Green River.
